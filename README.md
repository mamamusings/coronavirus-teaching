# Liz Lawley's Spring 2020 Online Teaching Resources

I've been writing up a lot of brief guides for colleagues since the sudden shift to online teaching this semester, and I've decided to move them here so that they're more easily accessible, updatable, and shareable.

***Please note that any instructions related to Zoom are based on RIT's Zoom implementation; if you are using a personal account some of these things won't work, and if you are at another university your interface may be different. Feel free to clone or fork this repository to customize it for your own purposes!***

If the line above sounds like gibberish to you, you can also email me at elizabeth.lawley@rit.edu or contact me on Discord at mamamusings#3282. Email responses may be delayed, however, due to the current volume of work-related email I'm getting!
